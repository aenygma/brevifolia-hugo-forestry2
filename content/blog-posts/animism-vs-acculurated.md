Animism is true to the primacy of experience over how to shape it.

Cultured religions are a way of imposing an ethical framework so as to guide experience to a communally accepted form.

Where the prior is a more basal and individually felt pursuit, the latter tends to be one where individual introspection has to be halted for the sake of a communally accepted one.

Humans are limbic system that spends most of its time in imagination. Oftentimes the imagination is adopted from one generation to another, or by where one finds themselves in relation to other people; Culture.

Culture is an inertia that orients and shapes deeply the way the limbic energies are brought out into the world.
