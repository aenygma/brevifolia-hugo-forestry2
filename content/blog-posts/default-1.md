What you want to know 

before you start, is 

"will it be worth it?"

It can come from caring, and wisdom

and equally from a fear, 

disguised as a need for security.

I'll save you the trouble.

1. You'll never know
2. You'll have to bend, too
3. The rest is up to your creativity, hopefully chosen and not chosen for.
